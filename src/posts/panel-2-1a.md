**SCRIPT**: *Spokesperson talking and traversing throughout the stage/scene*

Main purpose is to introduce the concepts of the course. This panel is optional because it's unconsequential to the LMS content and might be more distracting than helpful. We do have it though, in the event that it's wanted, OR in the event that it helps with the footage.

*Note: image is lower level/scale than that of some of the other images and was done more quickly than the others. Completed with shading and AEP masks though.*
