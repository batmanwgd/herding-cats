This is the graphic scene for panels 3.2 and 3.3. Illustrating a filmset, with special highlights for social distancing, wearing masks, cones, sanitizing productions stations, etc.

![Panels 3.2-3.3 Complete Filmset Scene](/images/3-2_3-3.jpg "Panels 3.2-3.3 Complete Filmset Scene")

**UPDATE:** *We are updating this panel to include a few more cones per the emphasis with the script and the LMS. We are also adding a secondary part to this panel that should cover the "zones"* 

Please enjoy. :-)
