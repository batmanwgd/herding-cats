**SCRIPT**: *Spokesperson talking and traversing throughout the stage/scene*

Main purpose is to introduce the concepts of the course. This panel is optional because it's unconsequential to the LMS content and might be more distracting than helpful. We do have it though, in the event that it's wanted, OR in the event that it helps with the footage.
