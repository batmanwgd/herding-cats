Wynn inline with the new storyboard marker/wet-ink/smeared shading look. Little bit more polish than some of the other graphics, ***but this is intentional***. 

We want to have her *(or even the other interviewees/narrators/spokespeople)* look a shot or two above the class of illustrations we have for the other elements.

**New Look:**
