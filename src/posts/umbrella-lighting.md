Umbrella and lighting graphics, meant to set the scene or be used as background articles. Likely won't move or really be in focus, so there isn't much to review. 

Due to the reduction in sketch quality requested, original draft will be re-finished with some shmutz, and likely via graphite with a re-entry to iPad processing without the cleanup.



***NOTE:** Please do not down vote this image for reasons of being "too polished" finishing will be re-done.*
