Please choose **one** of the following styles for the fonts on the body of the content for any given frame.

Style has been narrowed down to "art pen", "marker", and "craft pen" looks. We are playing with both all caps and smallcaps typography, depending on demographics

***UPDATED NOTE:** Because we have a voting panel open, we are going to keep iterating through the naming/numbering of options, BUT we will be eliminating options from this list below as they are narrowed down.*

**Option 1:**

**Option 2:**

**\*NOTE:** The story board frame will be the unchanged Courier New, but this is for the extra "bonus" content meant to be highlighted in frame instead.*
