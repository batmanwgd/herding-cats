Uncertain about use per updates within v2.0 and v2.1, but cycwall was meant to serve as a backdrop or scene setter for approximately 10 panels across scenes 13 through 18.

May potentially use, instead of the stage presentation as mentioned in panels 1.4/1D, 2.4/2D, and/or 3.11 or 3K of script v.2.1

***Author Note:** If used, remember the umbrella wall was chosen flat/transparent even within a 16 bit color space so a block wall treatment is needed.*
